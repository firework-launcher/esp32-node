# ESP32 Node

## Description
This runs on an ESP32, and acts as a 16 channel module. Groups of these can work together in a WiFi Mesh, and connect to a controller, which runs [firework-launcher/launcher](https://github.com/firework-launcher/launcher). It uses a different protocol than a regular IP launcher. The protocol is explained [here](protocol.md).
